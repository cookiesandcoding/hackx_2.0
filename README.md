This project is designed to analyze EEG (electroencephalogram) signals and classify them into three distinct categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. The system collects EEG data, processes brainwave patterns, and uses machine learning algorithms to interpret emotional or cognitive states.

* Positive results indicate high attention or engagement levels.
* Negative results reflect low attention or focus, suggesting possible cognitive disengagement.
* Neutral results serve as a baseline, showing balanced or average mental states.
  
The project aims to help users better understand their neurological responses in various scenarios, providing valuable insights into mental health and cognitive activity.
